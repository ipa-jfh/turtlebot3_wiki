SLAM
====

.. NOTE:: This instruction was tested on ``Ubuntu 16.04`` and ``ROS Kinetic Kame``.

.. WARNING:: Make sure to run the :ref:`[Bringup]<chapter_bringup>` instruction before performing SLAM.

.. TIP:: It is recommended to use a joystick pad instead of the keyboard for easier control.

The Simultaneous Localization and Mapping, or SLAM, is a technique to draw a map by estimating current location in an arbitrary space.

The SLAM is a well-known feature of TurtleBot from its predecessors. The video here shows you how accurately TurtleBot3 can draw a map with its compact and affordable platform.

Create a Map with Teleoperation
-------------------------------

.. TIP:: The terminal application can be found with the Ubuntu search icon on the top left corner of the screen. Shortcut key for terminal is Ctrl-Alt-T.

[``Remote PC``] Open a new terminal and launch the SLAM file.
If you have TurtleBot3 Burger,

.. code-block:: bash

  export TURTLEBOT3_MODEL=burger
  roslaunch turtlebot3_slam turtlebot3_slam.launch

If you have TurtleBot3 Waffle,

.. code-block:: bash

  export TURTLEBOT3_MODEL=waffle
  roslaunch turtlebot3_slam turtlebot3_slam.launch


[``Remote PC``] Visualize the model in 3D with RViz.

.. code-block:: bash

  rosrun rviz rviz -d `rospack find turtlebot3_slam`/rviz/turtlebot3_slam.rviz

[``Remote PC``] Teleoperation with Keyboard

.. code-block:: bash

  roslaunch turtlebot3_teleop turtlebot3_teleop_key.launch

Save the Map
------------

[``Remote PC``] Open a new terminal and run the map saver node.

.. code-block:: bash

  rosrun map_server map_saver -f ~/map

**map.pgm** and **map.yaml** files will be created in the ``~/`` directory ($HOME directory, /home/<username>).
