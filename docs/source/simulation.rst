.. WARNING:: The contents in this chapter corresponds to the ``Remote PC`` (your desktop or laptop PC) which will control TurtleBot3. Do **NOT** apply this instruction to your TurtleBot3.

.. NOTE:: This instruction was tested on ``Ubuntu 16.04`` and ``ROS Kinetic Kame``.

TurtleBot3 Fake Node Implementation
-----------------------------------

.. TIP:: The terminal application can be found with the Ubuntu search icon on the top left corner of the screen. Shortcut key for terminal is Ctrl-Alt-T.

Install dependent packages for TurtleBot3 Simulation.

.. NOTE:: turtlebot3_simulation package requires **TurtleBot3** (http://turtlebot3.robotis.com/en/latest/pc_software.html#install-dependent-packages) package as a prerequisite.

.. code-block:: bash

  cd ~/catkin_ws/src/
  git clone https://github.com/ROBOTIS-GIT/turtlebot3_simulations.git
  cd ~/catkin_ws && catkin_make

``TurtleBot3 fake node`` is a very simple simulation node that can be run without having an actual robot. You can even control the virtual TurtleBot3 in RViz with a teleop node.

.. code-block:: bash

  export TURTLEBOT3_MODEL=burger
  roslaunch turtlebot3_fake turtlebot3_fake.launch

.. code-block:: bash

  roslaunch turtlebot3_teleop turtlebot3_teleop_key.launch

.. TIP:: The terminal application can be found with the Ubuntu search icon on the top left corner of the screen. Shortcut key for terminal is Ctrl-Alt-T.

.. WARNING:: If you are running Gazebo for the first time on your ``Remote PC``, it takes a bit longer than usual.

You should set Turtlebot3 model parameter. Select either burger or waffle for the model parameter in the below command.

.. code-block:: bash

  export TURTLEBOT3_MODEL=burger

Below command will load TurtleBot3 on the default Gazebo environment ``TurtleBot3 empty world``.

.. code-block:: bash

  roslaunch turtlebot3_gazebo turtlebot3_empty_world.launch

.. image:: _static/simulation/turtlebot3_empty_world.png

If you wish to load more interesting map, please use below command instead of above command.  
``TurtleBot3 world`` is a map consists of simple objects that makes up the shape of TurtleBot3 symbol.  
  
.. code-block:: bash

  export TURTLEBOT3_MODEL=burger
  roslaunch turtlebot3_gazebo turtlebot3_world.launch

.. image:: _static/simulation/turtlebot3_world_bugger.png

.. image:: _static/simulation/turtlebot3_world_waffle.png

In order to control TurtleBot3 with a keyboard, please launch teleoperation feature with below command in a new terminal window.

.. code-block:: bash

  roslaunch turtlebot3_teleop turtlebot3_teleop_key.launch

In order to run TurtleBot3 simulation that autonomously navigates around the map, open a new terminal window and enter below command.

.. code-block:: bash

  export TURTLEBOT3_MODEL=burger
  roslaunch turtlebot3_gazebo turtlebot3_simulation.launch

RViz visualizes published topics while simulation is running. You can launch RViz in a new terminal window by entering below command.

.. code-block:: bash

  roslaunch turtlebot3_gazebo turtlebot3_gazebo_rviz.launch
